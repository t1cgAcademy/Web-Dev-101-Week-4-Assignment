### Javascript Object Exercise

This assignment is designed to provide practice with Javascript data structures, particularly
objects. There are two parts to this assignment. First, you will create an object containing
a list of 4 books. Each object will contain a title, author, and readingStatus. You will
then create a button that organizes the object according to readingStatus. Second, you will
create three inputs and a button. These inputs will take the same information from new books you want to enter,
and then add them to the list of already organized book information when the button is clicked.

1. You will have to remember how to create event listeners and attach functions.
2. Remember Object format!!!
3. Don't forget about your HTML and Javascript selectors!!!
4. Refer to previous lessons/assignments for instructions on cloning code and getting started.

### Extra Tasks

1. You will be making an array helper, which will take all of the unread books and display in array format
2. You will do the same but for read books
3. You will create an update array button, that will update
   both arrays with any new books added in the object generator since arrays were first created
