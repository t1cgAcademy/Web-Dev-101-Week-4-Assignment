### Javascript Object Exercise

This assignment is designed to provide practice with Javascript data structures, particularly
objects. There are two parts to this assignment. First, you will create an object containing
a list of 4 books. Each object will contain a title, author, and readingStatus. You will
then create a button that organizes the object according to readingStatus. Second, you will
create three inputs and a button. These inputs will take the same information from new books you want to enter,
and then add them to the list of already organized book information when the button is clicked.

1. You will have to remember how to create event listeners.
2. Remember Object format!!!
3. Don't forget about your HTML and Javascript selectors!!!
4. Refer to previous lessons/assignments for instructions on cloning code and getting started.
